I am someone who is really passionate about justice, ethics, education, logic, the theory of mind, the theory of judgement, Political philosophy, constructive mathematics, PSYCHOLOGISM, Anti-PSYCHOLOGISM , rational classical mechanics, Banach space theory, rational mathematical biology, computational social science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and linguistics. As an independent researcher, I am now working on the computational modelling of asthma. 

#This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A little bit about me
======

I obtained a master in pure mathematics under Professor Luíza Amália de Moraes (2005, Functional Analysis). In 2006, I started a PhD in rational mechanics under Professor Fernando Duda. In 2009, I was awarded a scholarship to do part of his research at McGill University, in Canada, under Professor Eliot Fried. From this collaboration, I published the relevant paper of my PhD-dissertation. In December 2010, I defended my dissertation successfully. In the Netherlands, I decided to change from research field what demanded a new specialization. In 2019, I obtained my second master degree in applied mathematics (CUM LAUDE) at the Leiden University in the Netherlands. In 2023, I obtained my third master degree in Methodology of Teaching (Mathematics) at Leiden University in the Netherlands. From now on, I will dedicate my life to apply my theoretical knowledge to help to unravel the underlying mechanisms of key biological processes within the framework of continuum mechanics in a data-driven manner.

#Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

#Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

PND-CAPPES-GRANT
======

In 2012, I was awarded with the PND-CAPPES-grant so as to work at CONICET in Argentina for three months. Thereby contributing to the numerical implementation of a phasefield model for fracture resulting in one publication.

PhD-CAPPES-GRANT
======

In 2009, I was awarded with the PND-CAPPES-grant so as to work at McGill University in Canada for 5 months under the supervision of Professor Eliot Fried. We established the asymptotic correspondence between a phase-field model and the classical Griffith’s theory for fracture resulting in one publication.

Recent Activities
======
I have accomplished the Educative Master at the University of Leiden, en now I am giving classes of mathematics in the upper-secondary-school level, which corresponds to pre-university students. 

Research
======
1) **Geometric Continuum Mechanics applied to biological growth**
  
2) **Phase-field theory applied to biological growth**
   
4) **Biophysics**
   
5) **Computational Biology**
   
6) **Mathematical Biology**
   



Recent Publications
======

Paper 1) **A phase-field model for the hydrogen-induced growth in plant cell walls (preprint)**.

Paper 2) **A continuum model within a riemannian geometric framework  for growth in plant morphogenesis capitalized on the configurational force theory(preprint)**.
